    <!--
      TOTAL WIDTH FOR THIS DRAWABLES VIEW IS 36DP
      TOTAL HEIGHT FOR THIS DRAWABLES VIEW IS 22DP

      FOR ANY POSITIONING USE DP VALUES. NOT GRAVITY. PORQUE?
      Because gravity doesn't provide definite values to a drawable
      within its overal bounds. It let's them scale themselves to
      match the given bounds. If however i keep all my values consistent
      E.G. i know how big excatly the bounds are going to be, then i can
      easily define positionings.

      Each value i define for left / top / right / bottom are push-values.
      What that means is how far from that side should the drawables bounds sit.
      Slightly back-asswards to the way drawing views works but oh well.
      So if given a 10dp box, and i set the right to 2dp, it's not saying
      the right of the drawable is @ 2dp, it's @ 8dp, because it is "pushed"
      2DP from the right.
