FUNPOPUP


-Displays a TextView with a shadowed background drawable that fades away after a specified time
-"Pops up" at a given location; Lingers for a few seconds; Fades away.

-MUST HAVES:
--TextView / Background / Text

-TextView
--Can be either made through code, or given to this Popup
















-------------------------------------------------[OLD]-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
-FEATURES
--Text is anchored with its coordinates being the tip of its arrow icon
--Restart feature (If in the process of fading away, i can "bring it back to life" so to speak, instead of instantiating a brand new one.
--Provides a simple API with static methods to easily create a new one via Method chaining. (builder pattern)
  E.G. FunPopup.play(Context).content(View).styling(int).haveFun().duration(long);
--Is shown for a specified duration then fades away for a specified duration
--Can call a function to quickly fade away. Call: mom()



-IMPORTANT
--FunPopup will expose naturally named methods (launch() dismiss() show() etc etc)
--The PlayRoom (FunPopups manager) will expose coolio named methods like play() mom() dad() etc etc that is essentially a Builder object

-NOTE
--Below are values entirely related to the functionality of FunPopup(TM) itself with NADA regard to the underlying Popup object.

-Flow
--When FunPopup is started it will create a new Handler() for itself, and when launched it will
  Send a postDelayedMessage() to its runnable. The message is delayed for *duration*; When *duration* is up, the method will
  send computed float values base on elapsed time, back to the Handler who will then set the alpha of FunPopups content; The Runnable
  calls the handlers postDelayed message again, thus creating a loop of Handler - > Runnable - >Handler - > Runnable that only breaks
  when an internal long value (elapsedTime) of the Runnable is equal to the given duration of the fade animation;

-Can change duration while its displayed
