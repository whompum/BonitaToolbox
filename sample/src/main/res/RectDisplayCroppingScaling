IF (bounds are equal (Wrap-Wrap) then do nothing

ELSE
-GOAL: Crop the Largest possible portion of the image that i can (So that it matches Aspect Ratio), then scale to fit boundaries
-NOTE: Cache the cropped image for future uses

PSUEDO:
#Fetch Rects of both view and Image
#Construct a Scale Rect
#Find the aspect ratio value of the image (smallest side / largest side)
#Using a boolean or aspect ratio enum, find the smallest side of the rect (enum = TALL/WIDE) (boolean = isWidthSmallest)
#Set smallestDimen to 2 (for centering purposes) and largest to 2 / aspect ratio
#Find which scaled view dimension has the closest distance to the images respective dimension (store in boolean isWidthClosestMatch)
#set closest match equal to its respective view dimension
#scale other dimension according to how it should be scaled. (other dimension (*/) ratio)
#set width / height values of scaled rect
#Center rect in the images rect
#Give to Cropper
#Crop
#PROFIT???
